A fast, extensive game engine written in Rust.

## Features

- **Fast and asynchronous ECS design**: FOX Engine uses an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture to manage game objects and their behavior. The ECS design is optimized for speed and asynchrony, allowing your game to run smoothly and efficiently. It also includes a dedicated ECS section for internal rendering.
- **OpenGL-based rendering**: FOX Engine uses OpenGL as the underlying graphics library, allowing it to support both 2D and 3D rendering. The engine includes an extensive vertex system that supports a wide range of rendering operations.
- **Uses the glium crate for rendering**: FOX Engine uses the `glium` crate to provide a safe and convenient wrapper around OpenGL, allowing you to take advantage of the power of OpenGL while writing safe Rust code.
- **Minimal codebase with minimal dependencies**: FOX Engine has a minimal codebase and few dependencies, making it easy to integrate into your project and reducing the risk of conflicts with other crates. This also means that the engine has a small footprint and can be compiled and run quickly.
